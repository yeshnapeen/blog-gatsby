This blog was created using the different component

First of all install the gatbsy library alongside with a boilerpage to kick start your project 

Afterward in the pages folder you will be able to add the different pages to use. In this blog, I focused on creating: 

- About : Show who I am 
- Blog : The different blogs posted 
- Contact : Which contains only my email for contact purposes
- Index: Which acts as a home page 

To add styling, I created another folder which possess all the styles using SASS and CSS

The blog was build in Nodejs and React js and the deployment done through Github and Netlify
