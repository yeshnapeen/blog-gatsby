>>>>- About: To let people know who I was 
>>>> - Blog:  Where the blog list would be published 
>>>> - Contact : How to get in contact with me 
>>>> - Index: The index page will be your homepage and this the only page that will be present in the pages folder when you build the project

>>>>After setting up your pages the next step would be to use style the pages. I’ve created a folder component and add the SCSS files for each page.

>>>>You could connect your blog to Contentful or Wordpress. You just have to install the required plugins 

>>>>For this blog simplicity, I’ve decided to go with Markdown. More information can be found: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-markdown-pages/
